In one, it is said that she fell in love with someone. This someone who is a hunter has met Maria while stumbling upon her land. Soon they fell in love, but their time together <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnCAmr569k" title="End Game by t-swift">ended</a> as soon after their love bloomed. One day, Maria learned about the hunter's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEPomqor2A8" title="no body no crime by t. swift">infidelity</a> and has came to a conclusion that all people are like that. So she has closed off all the access of the resources of her territory and made it so that people can't benefit off of it.<br></br>Another story talks about Maria being a protector of a certain farmer because she is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BjZmE2gtdo" title="lover by t-swift">love</a> with him. Then one day, he received a news of single young men being be recruited. Because of this, he willed himself to marry another mortal who is not Maria. When she heard of this, she never returned back to the town.<br></br>Another rendition of this story was set in the Spanish colonial period. It was said that Maria was liked by three people. And the one that she resonated with the most is Juan, a poor farmer. With the other two people's efforts gone to waste, they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teos2yMvkEA" title="Mastermind by t-swift">plotted</a> something against Juan. They franed him, and that led to his execution. Maria was devasted that she didn't get there in time to save Juan. With this, she placed a curse upon those who cannot accept that they were denied of, in terms of their feelings. After the curse was placed, the two suitors died.</p>
