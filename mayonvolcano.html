She caught the attention of two people in this story. One of which is Kauen and other is Gat Malaya. Kauen's way of showing his affection to the maiden is by giving her these expensive gifts, but it did not work for her. Gat Malaya and Daragang Magayon met beside a river while the maiden is picking flowers. This is where they started to know, develop feelings for each other, and even suggested marriage!. This news reached Kauen's ears and he was not happy about it. Gat Malaya returned to his home so that he could relay the message that he is going to get marriage to his parents. The only problem is that his home is far from Albay. Kauen took the opportunity to force the maiden to be wed to him if her lover didn't return. In time for the wedding, Gat Malaya returned from his home. He and Kauen fought for a place in her heart even though the other didn't have the chance. Daragang Magayon died from the spear Kauen threw to the air. While Gat Malaya is mourning for her death, his opponent killed him. They both died and buried side by side. The soil that covered the lovers grew and grew until it became the Mayon Volcano. https://www.tagaloglang.com/the-legend-of-mount-mayon/</p>
